Unofficial app for 50five (formerly New Motion and Shell Recharge). Adds support for private EV charging points found on https://50five-snl.evc-net.com/. The portal URL may be different for your country, update this in the app settings using repair or during pairing.

This app is inspired on the great work of Jaime Visser's The New motion app.
I rewrote the app to make it work with the private chargers instead of the public charge points.

Getting started
This app is focused on your own chargepoints. The once that are registered to your own account. You also need at least one valid rfid card linked to your account (authorized) in my 50five. While adding a charge point you can select what card to use for that chargepoint, it will be used for the start session actions. From flow cards you can use other cards for other scenario's/ 
Make sure you have a 50five account with at least one chargepoint and one card connected. Then use the add device to start the wizard.

The app stores you credentials safely, to update these you need to use repair funtion.
Changing the default card can be done in the device settings.

Usage
In the flow editor use the triggers to start a flow when someone starts/stops charging or when there are free connectors.
Turn on/off the chargepoint to start a charing session using your attached charge card

Supported devices
Private new motion/shell recharge charge points for electric vehicles
